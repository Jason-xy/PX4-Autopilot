# NxtPX4

NxtPX4 aims to meet the demand for small size PX4 flight controller in Omni-Swarm project and future projects. NxtPX4 bases on STM32H743VIH which can be replaced by STM32H750VIH or STM32H753VIH. STM32H7 has 480MHz CPU frequency and has a good performance in signal processing. We use three IMU on NxtPX4: MPU6500(SPI1), ICM20602(SPI2),BMI088(SPI3). These three IMU enable users to get more accurate data in different experiments and make NxtPX4 long time available.

NxtPX4 now is developed on PX4 version 1.13.2
